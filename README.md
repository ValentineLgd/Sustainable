protect the website & the database from random users deleting/editing the work of others.

## **UX**

This website is my third MileStone project for my Fullstack Software Develpment diploma.
The aim of this website was to create a website implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
In my personal life, I already noticed how hard it was to find sustainables clothes brands
that you can trust to buy clothes without hurting others or the planet. That's why I decided
that a database gathering information freely accessible for everyone could be valuable.

- *category* : is this brand for men/women or for both? While most of them are for both sexes, 
it can be handy to get this information.
- *description* : the user adding the brand has to describe the brand in a few sentences explaining
why he loves it & what the brand offers.

When each brand is added by a user, these 5 catagories are required in order for the brand to be added to the catalogue.

Add/edit/delete functionalities & ask a few friends to test the functionalities on their side

## **Design**

I am really interested regarding design, and paid a special attention to this website
design. My goal was to make it simple, minimalist and interactive - in order to put
the user in the heart of the website.

**_Colour schemes_**

In this way I decided to choose a simple contrast between black and white colors,
enhanced by colors added to edit/add buttons (as these buttons are the key to add
value to the current catalogue).

**_Typography_**

Regarding the typography, I decided to use 2 Google fonts :
- Indie Flower : because of his young, and natural effect, as it reproduces human 
writing;
- Lato : to contrast with the round effect given by Indie Flower & give more substance
to the paragraph with a more classic typography.

**_Icons_**
I decided to use Fontawesome in order to provide illustrations in my website 
as it offers a wide catalogue of icons.

## **Frameworks**

1. _Flask_ : A framework written in Python that gives a lot of flexibility to the coding
2. _Bootstrap_ : I decided to stick to bootstrap as I find some of the functionalities
really easy & handy to use and like his overall design & flexibility.
2. _JQuery_ : I used some JQuery codes to enhance the interacte effect of the website
by making div slide in while the user discovers the website. The code I used where
definetely adapted from the current source : [TO ADD]

## **Wireframes** 

I used Balsamic to build my wireframe prior to the website coding.

The idea was to get an idea of what sections I would build and what design 
I would roughly create. Wireframes were built regarding desktop, tablet and phone 
versions:

[TO ADD]

From the idea to the realization, a lot of changes have been performed - especially
regarding the add of register/log in functionalities as I realized later on the project that 
it would be necessary to protect to the database against vandalism.
